The Kranion, a Sci-fi Spin-off of parasitic face parasites.

-- Initial Notes

Demo scenes are in LB3D/Monster_Kranion_<x>/Scenes

The demo scene is a simple demonstration of the character. Reset it simply by stopping and replaying. 
There are two other scenes that show a demonstration of the head-grab or face-grab animation. 

You may find the monster prefabs in the LB3D/Monster_Kranion_<x>/Prefabs folder.

You will find two prefabs. One is based on the demo, the other one is without the temp-controller that it ships with.

It is suggested that you create an animation controller for this character consistent with your game. The one provided is sufficient for basic needs, but your game will need it's own implementation.

Create colliders that are optimal for your game. (I have not attached colliders, because this is a very subjective and specific thing for your own game functionality)

-- About the Character

These are about the size of a default game character. You will have to scale them down to be more critter-like if that is your wish, especially for the facegrab / headgrab animations. 

If you wish to animate a jump sequence where the creature lands on some poor bastard's face, you have a START jump animation (for the launch) and a MID-PHASE animation (flying through air) and then upon face / head contact, you can switch to the last animation of facial anchorage. If the critter misses, there is also a JUMP-END phase. Thus you have 3 parts.

Please note there are 3 versions of textures:
- Low detail (original)
- High Detail (default)
- HDRP (optional to be used in High Defintion Render Pipeline)
