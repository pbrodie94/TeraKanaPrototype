Stabber_Slug

Demo scene is in LB3D/Monster_Stabber_Slug/Scenes

The demo scene is a simple demonstration of the character. Reset it simply by stopping and replaying.

You may find the monster prefabs in the LB3D/Monster_Stabber_Slug/Prefabs folder.

NOTE: This creature should be kept about .08 above ground on the Y axis. Experiment in your game to get his float right.

Prefab Stabber_Slug: The basic prefab you may integrate into your game.
Prebab Stabber_Slug_Demo: The one included in the demo scene. 

It is suggested that you create an animation controller for this character consistent with your game.

To obtain results such as in the video previews, you must use the Cinemachine and Post-Processing packages available in the package manager. 

Create colliders that are optimal for your game. (I have not attached colliders, because this is a very subjective and specific thing for your own game functionality)

You can see the "Demo" prefab for an example character controller.
