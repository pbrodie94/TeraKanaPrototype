Monster Sluggor

Demo scene is in LB3D/Monster_Sluggor/Scenes

The demo scene is a simple demonstration of the character. Reset it simply by stopping and replaying.

You may find the monster prefabs in the LB3D/Monster_Sluggor/Prefabs folder.

There is a basic prefab you may integrate into your game.
There is another one that included in the demo scene. 

It is suggested that you create an animation controller for this character consistent with your game.

Create colliders that are optimal for your game. (I have not attached colliders, because this is a very subjective and specific thing for your own game functionality)

You can see the "Demo" prefab for an example character controller.
